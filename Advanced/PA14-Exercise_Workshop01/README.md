# Workshop Custom Linked List

## Overview

### In this workshop, we are going to create another custom data structure, which has similar functionalities as the Java LinkedList. Just like the structures from the previous workshop, our custom LinkedList will work only with integers.

1. The DoublyLinkedList will have the following functionalities
   * ```void addFirst(T element)``` – adds an element at the beginning of the collection</br>
   * ```void addLast(T element)``` – adds an element at the end of the collection</br>
   * ```int get(int index)``` - returns the element at the specified position in this list</br>
   * ```int removeFirst()``` – removes the element at the beginning of the collection</br>
   * ```int removeLast()``` – removes the element at the end of the collection</br>
   * ```void forEach()``` – goes through the collection and executes a given action</br>
   * ```T[] toArray()``` – returns the collection as an array</br>

### **Update:** </br>
***I've refactored the LinkedList to work with any data type.</br>
In addition, I've made ```toArray()``` method to return an array of Integer, String and Boolean.***
