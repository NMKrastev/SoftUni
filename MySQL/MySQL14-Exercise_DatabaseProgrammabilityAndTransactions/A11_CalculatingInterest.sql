#Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_calculate_future_value_for_account that accepts as parameters â€“ id of account and interest rate.
#The procedure uses the function from the previous problem to give an interest to a person's account for 5 years,
#along with information about his/her account id, first name, last name and current balance as it is shown in the example below.
#It should take the account_id and the interest_rate as parameters. Interest rate should have precision up to 0.0001,
#same as the calculated balance after 5 years. Be extremely careful to achieve the desired precision!
